## 1. Introduction

This dataset accompanies paper by Amjad, M., Sidorov, G., Zhila, A. Data Augmentation using Machine Translation for Fake News Detection in the Urdu Language (2020), LREC 2020 (accepted).

This is a language resource which contains a dataset of 900 news articles originally in Urdu annotated as real or fake. Additionally, it contains a 400 news article as an augmentation dataset generated using Google Translate MT system from English to Urdu, as well as a number of combinations of these datasets for exploration of the augmentation effect.
